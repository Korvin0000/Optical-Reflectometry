# Investigation of the pyroelectric effect in Y-splitter (modulator) designed by lithium niobate crystal
#This effect means that in the certain temperature range the modulator doesn't work properly. Exactly, it blocks the passing radiation at low temperatures.
#We decided to understand this effect by the OFDR technique (https://sphotonics.ru/articles/43171/). For this, we used LUNA OBR4600.

#In my code, initially I read files and make the Fourier transformation for the area of modulator. After this, I get the reflectogramms at the range of temperature (-60,60,2). Further, I build the map and analyze the parameters of each reflectogramm.
